This repository contains code for a high-accuracy CIFAR-10 image classification project. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Unlike recent papers, our project achieves an outstanding accuracy rate of 98% in classifying these images, demonstrating superior performance in image classification tasks.

## Features
